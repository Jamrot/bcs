Automatically generating function summaries for binaries is an extremely valuable but challenging task, as it involves considering the execution behavior and semantics of the low-level language (Assembly code) into human-readable natural language. However, most current work on understanding assembly code is oriented towards generating function names, which involve numerous abbreviations that make it still confusing to comprehend. To bridge this gap, we focus on generating complete summaries of binary functions, especially for stripped binary (no symbol table and debug information in reality).
To fully exploit the semantics of assembly code, we present a Control flow graph and Pseudo code guided Binary Code Summarization (CP-BCS) framework. The framework utilizes a bidirectional instruction-level control flow graph and human knowledge contained pseudo code learns the comprehensive binary function execution behavior and semantics. We extensively evaluated CP-BCS on 3 different binary optimization levels (O1, O2, O3) for 3 different computer architectures (x86, x64, arm). The evaluation results demonstrate the superiority of CP-BCS and significantly improve the efficiently of reverse engineering.
